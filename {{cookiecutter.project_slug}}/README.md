### Pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks run all the auto-formatting (`ruff format`), linters (e.g. `ruff`), and other quality
 checks to make sure the changeset is in good shape before a commit/push happens.

You can install the hooks with (runs for each commit):

```sh
pre-commit install
```

Or if you want them to run only for each push:

```sh
pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

Or if you want e.g. want to run all checks manually for all files:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```
